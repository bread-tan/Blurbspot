 Tame Impala is a psychedelic rock band from Perth, Australia. It is the project of Kevin Parker who writes and records almost all of the music by himself. The live band consists of Kevin Parker (lead guitar and vocals), Dominic Simper (guitar and synth), Jay Watson (synth and backing vocals), Julien Barbagallo (drums), Nick Allbrook (ex-bassist) who decided to leave the band mid 2013 and is now being replaced by their close friend, Cam Avery (drummer of Pond).
 
 Their name refers to the impala, a medium sized antelope. Their musical sound draws from a wide range of influences (most notably &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s psychedelic rock) and they like to see themselves as &#8220;a steady flowing psychedelic groove rock band that emphasizes dream-like melody.&#8221; 
 
 The band signed a worldwide deal with label Modular Recordings in mid 2008, releasing their self titled EP in late 2008 and the single &#8216;Sundown Syndrome&#8217; in 2009. Their debut album, &#8220;Innerspeaker&#8221;, was released in 2010 to widespread critical acclaim. Their second album, &#8220;Lonerism&#8221;, is released in October of 2012.
